# Pathmaster
[Pathmaster](https://pathmaster.tech/) is a web app that explores pathfinding visualization using chess pieces. Basically, it's pathfinding for grandmasters.

This project was built for COP3530: Data Structures and Algorithms at the University of Florida. (1st Place 😃).

## Todo
- [x] fix button animation
- [x] fix reset button
- [x] change node component to behave like an actual component
- [ ] better dynamic placement of header, grid, and footer (make it fullscreen)
- [x] make grid into its own component
- [ ] avoid holes when highlighting fast
- [x] dynamic grid sizing based on size of screen
- [x] add animation when inserting wall and removing wall
- [ ] add movable start and finish nodes
- [ ] add more algorithms (is A* weighted bugged)--bidirectional, DFS/IDS?
- [x] optimize code to only update relevant nodes, not the entire grid!!!!!!!!!!!! (might need to refactor everything)
- [ ] add further optimizations to make it run like butter
- [x] implement pawn easter egg
- [x] slow down animation a little bit
- [ ] add hidden tribute to Aman (over the heart in the footer)
- [ ] add indication for no path found
- [ ] pause animation when not on screen
- [ ] add little chess piece to path visualization (remove filling in every square in between and just have the piece jump node to node)
- [ ] create logo and favicon
- [ ] redesign header UI to have minimal text
- [ ] add an info modal that gives a tutorial / explains what the different colors mean / what the controls are
- [ ] ability to change between preset wall patterns (random walls, preset maze, cool patterns)
- [ ] ability to change between different board themes (dark mode, very important)
- [ ] redraft UI and color scheme (remove "select" text)
- [ ] fix all the CSS to be dynamic and flexible
- [ ] add modal explaining control and choices (could be a sort of key)
- [ ] write readme
- [ ] comment code (lmao no thanks)
- [x] make video demo and other documentation for project submission
- [x] fix styling of run and reset buttons
- [ ] make header and footer much smaller
- [ ] option to speed up animation
- [ ] keyboard shortcuts (r for run? c for reset / clear?)
- [ ] reorder pieces to be in chess piece value
- [ ] hover over piece to see how it moves modal
